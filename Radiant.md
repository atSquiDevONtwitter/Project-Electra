# About Radiant

This is the open-source area that will be used for updates of Project Radiant, which is currently closed-source.

Radiant might remain closed-source for the remainder of the development, or possibly for the rest of eternity.

Currently, the scope of both Project Electra and Project Radiant are unknown, or classified by SquiDev, the head developer of Radiant. Please be patient for updates, as they will be released as soon as Radiant's website has been developed.

Currently writing this message is Glycerin, who is the head developer of Electra. These projects will be hosted on SquiDev's GitHub page for the time being.

Thanks for all of your support.
